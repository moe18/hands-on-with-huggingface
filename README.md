## Intro
### Why Should I Read This <a name="Why-Should-I-Read-This"></a>
This repo will be a hands on way to learn the popular NLP library [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) while there are plenty of resources already online for example https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/1?fw=tf that is well written and straight from hugging face themselves, so natruly the next question is why read mt guuid well my goal is to make a more hands on approach to learning this subject. I will do this by taking an example driven approach to this study guide, as well as put in examples you can try by yourself at the end of each chapter/section(I will also do the example myself incase you want to check your work and if you think your answer is better let me know, I am always looking for better ways to do things). The main goal of this guide is to give you the ability to create machine learning projects using hugging face so you can have another great tool in your machine learning tool kit

### Prerequisites <a name="Prerequisites"></a>
This study guide assumes you know some basic machine learning and as well as some python, and you need to want to learn more about NLP/Huggingface (I know I am cheesey get used to it)
