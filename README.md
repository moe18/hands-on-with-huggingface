## Intro
### Why Should I Read This <a name="Why-Should-I-Read-This"></a>
This repo will be a hands on way to learn the popular NLP library [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) while there are plenty of resources already online for example https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/1?fw=tf that is well written and straight from hugging face themselves, so natruly the next question is why read mt guuid well my goal is to make a more hands on approach to learning this subject. I will do this by taking an example driven approach to this study guide, as well as put in examples you can try by yourself at the end of each chapter/section(I will also do the example myself incase you want to check your work and if you think your answer is better let me know, I am always looking for better ways to do things). The main goal of this guide is to give you the ability to create machine learning projects using hugging face so you can have another great tool in your machine learning tool kit

### Prerequisites <a name="Prerequisites"></a>
This study guide assumes you know some basic machine learning and as well as some python, and you need to want to learn more about NLP/Huggingface. You should know how to make functions as well as the basics of neural networks and how to make them with tensorflow (or any other deep learning library) 


## The HuggingFace Landscape  <a name="The-HuggingFace-Landscape"></a>
"The AI community building the future. Build, train and deploy state of the art models powered by the reference open source in machine learning." I got this quote from the home page of the HuggingFace website while this sounds nice and all in this chapter I will talk about what this actually means and what hugging face is and what their goals are and what use cases you can use them for.




## End to End Huggingface Project <a name="End-to-End-Huggingface-Project"></a>
In this section we will build an end to end Huggingface project where you will learn:
- set up an environment and install hugging face
- get text data as well as do some analysis on it
- use Huggingface pipeline to make some NLP models

and after you finish reading this chapter you can try and do the exercises and test how well you understood the material
